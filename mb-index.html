            I have a 2 year old daughter, Laurel, with my wife, Karena. Karena teaches in Durham Public Schools as a middle school Science teacher. 
            Before we moved to Raleigh a year and half ago, we had been living on the Southern Outer Banks for the last four or so years. With my wife's
            help, I ran a small bakery and coffee/espresso truck operation for part of that time.

            Together, we bought a small piece of land north of Raleigh about three years ago. A year or so after that I bought a 1960 something International 
            Harvester 140, mostly to cut the grass. We want to raise perennial crops like asparagus or truffles maybe. We also have an idea to raise 
            grasshoppers on foraged kudzu as potential food source for humans, but also to feed to chickens in addition to being a part of a greenhouse 
            soil fertility program.

            At the conclusion of an MA in Communication program at UNC-Greensboro, I wrote my thesis about an idea that is still very important to me: 
            Public Produce. I believe that without public space democracy could not exist, that public space is constitutive of democracy.
            To continue to strengthen this space of participatory democracy, the planting of food for anyone's consumption on public land can perhaps
            begin to address issues of food security in our communities and, more importantly, Public Produce can serve as a symbolic space for 
            conversations concerning the resources that we all hold in common.
